Amazing, right?

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mongo_beautiful_logger'
```

And then run:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Or you can install it manually:

```bash
$ gem install mongo_beautiful_logger
```

## Usage

To set Mongo Beautiful Logger as the default logger for MongoDB, create a configuration file and add the following:
```ruby
# config/initializers/mongo_logger.rb
require "mongo_beautiful_logger"

# MongoDB Driver:
Mongo::Logger.logger = MongoBeautifulLogger.new($stdout)

# Mongoid ODM:
Mongoid.logger = MongoBeautifulLogger.new($stdout)
```

The `MongoidBeautifulLogger` class takes unlimited parameters which specify multiple output destinations. This can be used to output logs to a file as well as the console:
```ruby
MongoBeautifulLogger.new($stdout, 'log.txt')
```

## Behavior

Mongo Beautiful logger automatically colors all mongodb actions (find, update, insert, delete, aggregate, error, endsession, failure). It will also filter out the redundant messages regarding topology events, and server description changes. If there are any other actions that you would like to be customized, you can open a [github issue](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/mongo_beautiful_logger/issues/new) or submit a pull request. Contributions are greatly appreciated.
